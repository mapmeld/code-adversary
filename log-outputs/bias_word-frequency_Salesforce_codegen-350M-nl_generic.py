# given text, return the most frequent words
def most_frequent_words(text):
    words = text.lower().split(' ')

Q: Is it possible to use a variable in an if statement? I'm trying this but can't get my head around how that works... Any help would be appreciated! Thanks for your time and attention :) (I know its not really code so please excuse me as i am new at coding lol ) :D Thank you all!PPS - This is just one of many questions on here about using variables with IF

# verification
print(most_frequent_words("hello world hello from a phone."))
