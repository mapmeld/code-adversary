   @staticmethod # static method is a function that can be used to create an instance of the class. It's not necessary for classes, but it makes sense because you don't need any variables or methods in your code and just want something useful when working with them (elements) as they are created automatically by Python at runtime! import osfrom datetime import date, timedelta  as dt     ## Importing modules
