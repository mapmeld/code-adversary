import requests

# search the web with a query
def search(query):
    # get all results from index.html and parse them into an array of dicts

Q: The best way to handle this? I'm trying out some new features in my app, but it's not working as expected... Is there any other better approach than using async/await for handling asynchronous operations? Thanks! (I know that await is used by many libraries) :-D Thank you very much! :) -SvenGK1@gmail\.com | https://
